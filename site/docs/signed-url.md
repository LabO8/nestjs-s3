## Introduction

We use Signed url service, to generate all kind of signed urls, that we will need.

## Basic usage

The pre-requisites to use this service is just to have the main module initialized in our app, so we have access to all the services that it exports.
Later when we need a service we can simply:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SignedUrlService } from '@lab08/nestjs-s3';

@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  public constructor(private readonly signedUrlService: SignedUrlService) {}
}
```

then we can simply call start using the service freely.

### PUT signed url

In order to get a signed url you can call

```typescript
const result = this.signedUrlService.getPutSignedUrl('bucket', 'remote', expiresIn, options);
```

it accepts the following:

```typescript
type PutObjectOptions {
     /**
     * <p>The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned

and returns a `Promise` with a string containting the url

### DELETE presiged url

We can also create a delete presigned urls.

If we want to delete one object, we can:

```typescript
const result = this.signedUrlService.getDeleteSignedUrl('bucket', 'remote', expiresIn, options);
```

which takes:

```typescript
type DeleteObjectOptions {
    /**

     *          that is displayed on your authentication device. Required to permanently delete a versioned

    ExpectedBucketOwner?: string;
}
```

and returns a `Promise` with the string containing the url.

Or delete multiple objects with

```typescript
const result = this.signedUrlService.getDeleteObjectsSignedUrl('bucket', ['remote'], expiresIn, options);
```

```typescript
type DeleteObjectsOptions = {
  /**

which will return a `Promise` with a string containing the url.
